This is a simple example robot that demonstrates to users a few different ways in which they can copy data from one Excel column to another.

All files necessary to run this bot are already included. Be sure to review the content of the each file before running to understand what changes occurred.

You can open the excel files before running the robot to check how they change after running. If you run the robot multiple times, remember to reset the files to their original state.

To run the Robot Framework example use:
`rcc run -t "Run robot tasks"`

To run with Python use:
`rcc run -t "Run with Python"`
